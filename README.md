# RIL-Intern-project-
During my internship, I conducted an in-depth study of compressor control systems within a compressed gas cracker unit, 
focusing on their impact on operational efficiency and system stability. 
The project involved analyzing various instruments used in the gas cracker unit, including pressure transducers, temperature sensors, and flow meters, to evaluate their roles in optimizing compressor performance.
I have also studied and observed the value of anti surge control systems in CCC systems.
